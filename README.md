# PRINTF

In C, printf is a function that does formatted printing. 
We are tasked to design our own printf function. 
Our code will be compiled this way: "$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c"

## Tasks
###Task 0. I am not going mywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I am here and I am a spur for life

Write a function that produces output according to a format.

* Function Prototype: int_printf(const char *format, ...);
* Returns: Number of characters printed excluding the null byte used to end output to strings
* Writes output to stdout stream
* Format is a character string composed of zero or more directives. The following conversion specifiers are being handled.
1. c
